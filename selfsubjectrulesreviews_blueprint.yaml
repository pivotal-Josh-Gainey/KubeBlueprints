KIND:     SelfSubjectRulesReview
VERSION:  authorization.k8s.io/v1

DESCRIPTION:
     SelfSubjectRulesReview enumerates the set of actions the current user can
     perform within a namespace. The returned list of actions may be incomplete
     depending on the server's authorization mode, and any errors experienced
     during the evaluation. SelfSubjectRulesReview should be used by UIs to
     show/hide actions, or to quickly let an end user reason about their
     permissions. It should NOT Be used by external systems to drive
     authorization decisions as this raises confused deputy, cache
     lifetime/revocation, and correctness concerns. SubjectAccessReview, and
     LocalAccessReview are the correct way to defer authorization decisions to
     the API server.
